# AdLcom
A AdLib Driver for serial port.

This is a AdLib TSR Program for MS-DOS Forked from the project AdLipt instead of using LPT port is using COM port to send the Register and value to a serial port.

## Hardware Requirements
 - OPL2Board https://www.tindie.com/products/cheerful/opl2-audio-board/ 
 Or
 - OPL3Duo https://www.tindie.com/products/cheerful/opl3-duo/
 - Arduino Nano
 - MAX232L https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01N42QW8X/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o03_s01?ie=UTF8&psc=1
 - 386 Computer
 - Memory Manager JEMM or QEMM or EMM386

## Download

Download the driver from [the Github releases tab][2].

## Wiring instructions

Before usage you should follow the instructions from

https://github.com/DhrBaksteen/ArduinoOPL2


Connect the Arduino to the OPL2Board and Connect the MAX232 with this wiring guide.<br />

MAX232 PIN          Arduino\
VCC "<------------->" 3.3V\
TX  "<------------->" TX\
RX  "<------------->" RX\
GND "<------------->" GND



## Usage

Load the TSR with the command:

    ADLCOM

assuming the  board is plugged into COM1. It will use about a
kilobyte of RAM. It can be loaded into high memory using the DOS `LH`
command.

The TSR can be unloaded with the command:

    ADLCOM UNLOAD

### JEMM

Load ADLCOM using the command:

    JLOAD JADLCOM.DLL

### Options


- **`COM1`/`COM2`/`COM3`/`COM4`** Select COM port.

- **`BLASTER=220`** Enable Sound Blaster FM emulation. ADLCOM will
  intercept the Sound Blaster FM ports in addition to the standard
  AdLib ports. (It won't however fake enough of a Sound Blaster to
  pass installation checks, so this won't be very useful if you don't
  have a Sound Blaster.)

- **`NOPATCH`** Disable runtime patching. Without runtime patching the
  TSR will be much slower, but the I/O timing will be much more
  regular, which might help with software that's very timing
  sensitive.

- **`OPL3`** Enable support for OPL3 Board.should be used with Nuke.YKT
  Protocol.

## Source code

This program compiles with OpenWatcom, use the `build.sh` script.
You'll also need Python 3 and [the Ragel state machine
compiler][Ragel].
